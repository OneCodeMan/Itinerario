# Itinerario
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand.

## Info
An app that generates a travel itinerary given a city, number of days and interests.
User can create an account, generate an itinerary, save an itinerary, delete an itinerary.

I made this to practice SwiftUI and Swift in general. I also wanted to practice MVVM.

There is a `commits.txt` in the Fastlane directory. Periodically, I run a lane to fetch the most recent commits, in hopes that this can be some sort of development log using my commits. It also motivates me to take writing commits seriously.

## Technology/techniques used
Firebase, SwiftUI, OpenAI API.
